your// here we are gonna learn how to concatenate arrays
// we have already done concatenation of two arrays and here we want to talk about concatenation of three arrays and arrays and values
// As you can see we have three arrays with the name of players
// We want to join the three lists into one.....that means we have to concatenate the three arrays 
// And using the first array and the method .concat outside the paranthesis we will have the other two arrays inside the paranthesis and they will be separated by a comma

// Using the same method we can concatenate arrays with values....we will enclose the values in square brackets and enclose the square brackets in paranthesis and we use the .concat method and the values in the square brackets will be merged with the elements in the array
