let myClass = ["sam","stosh","kip","bob","george","frank"];
myClass.toString();// The method .toString converts arrays to string
let myPeople = ["ian","lenny","brent","mose","hawi","fabish","mark","dima"];
myPeople.join(); // The method .join works the same way as the method .toString
// Another method is the .pop method that removes elements from an array......the method removes the last element in the array
// We will work with the .pop method at the terminal
//As you can see after using the .pop method the element "dima" which is the last element is popped out
// We are gonna look at anther method and this is te .push method that adds new elements to an array
// We are gonna work out an example in the terminal and we are gonna add the element "musungu" in the array 
// We have the .shift method that works like the .pop method but the difference is that this method acts on the first element and not the last like the .pop
// Just like the .pop has a counter this method also has a counter
// this is the .unshift method that adds elements at the beginning of the array
// elements in an array are accessed using their index numbers and thats how they can also be changed
// check on the illustraion below on the terminal
// The fact that elements can be accessed and changed means they can be deleted too
// The same way you use an index number to change an element is the same way you use the index n to delete the element
// An illustration is in the terminal
// .splice method can be used to add more items to an array
// I have illustrated that in the terminal below
